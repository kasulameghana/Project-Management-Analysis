Analysis of the Crashed Project - FBI Virtual Case Files

- The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began developing a case management software system called the Virtual Case File in 2000 but eventually abandoned the project in April 2005.

- The cost of this project was estimated to be over $170 million, and this waste of tax payer money drew sharp criticism. The impetus for the project was due to the FBI’s aging technology infrastructure that included 386-based personal computers and a 12-year-old network system.

- In 2000, Congress allocated almost $340 million for the proposed FBI Information Technology Upgrade Project (FITUP) that was soon divided into three parts and renamed Trilogy. 

- This project was scheduled to take three years and included an enterprise-wide upgrade of desktop hardware and software and the implementation of a more modern and secure network. 
- In addition, a Virtual Case File system would include a case management system, an evidence management system, and a records management system that would replace the FBI’s antiquated case management system which limited the FBI’s ability to carry out its mission effectively.

This study provides a qualitative analysis of this Project Management Practices attempted in the FBI VCF Project. 
More specifically, this study attempts to answer the questions like
- Was the failure of the FBI’s Virtual Case File project unique?
- What are the specific problems in terms of scope, Human Resources, Budget, and Culture?
- When to pull the plug?

The whole study is done in a Project fashion with specific deadlines, Work Breakdown structures, Risk Analysis and Control & Monitor Practices.

This case study should be of interest to IT academics in terms of teaching project management or as a theoretical basis for guiding future research. This study should also be of interest to IT practitioners in terms of understanding some important project management challenges when attempting to implement an IT solution
